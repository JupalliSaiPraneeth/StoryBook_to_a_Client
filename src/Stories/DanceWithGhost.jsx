The night was alive, yet I felt distant. Surrounded by my friends at the concert, we sat down, exhausted. The cool breeze brushed against my skin, but nothing felt colder than the emptiness inside me.

Then, the guitarist played.

A single note, and my heart clenched. That soundâ€”it was you. It was us.

Before I knew it, I stood up. My eyes closed. My arms lifted, tracing the shape I knew so well. And suddenly, you were there. Your waist fit perfectly in my embrace, your fingers slipping into mine like they belonged there forever. Your glass-pearl eyes locked onto me, your smile warming me in a way the sun never could. You were wearing the dress I gave you on your birthday, twirling in my arms, laughing softly. I could feel your heartbeat, or maybe it was just the echo of my own as if this moment was always meant to be. We swayed to the rhythm of a love that once was. I held your waist, spinning you gently. You laughed, weightless in my arms.

Then, the singer's voice filled the air:

 "Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms 
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song 
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful 
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight" 

I pulled you closer, holding you tightly as if I could keep you here forever. 
And then
I opened my eyes. You were never there. 
My vision blurred, the weight of reality sinking in. A warmth wrapped around me- my friend, pulling me into an embrace. Their voice was soft, almost distant. 
"That was one of the best dances I've ever seen."
If only they knew-I wasn't dancing alone..
