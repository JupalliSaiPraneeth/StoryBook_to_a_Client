Let it rain tonight—
Let the skies weep for what we are about to do.

Kill me with the arms
That once wrapped around me like I was your shelter in the storm.
Kill me with the smile
That broke through my clouds like morning sun.
Let the rain trickle down your cheeks—
So no one knows if you’re crying.
Wear the earrings I gave you,
Let them catch the drops,
Gleaming like the stars I once saw in your eyes.

Put on that birthday dress—
The one that danced when you spun under fairy lights.
Let it cling to your skin, soaked and heavy—
Like my heart.

Take the knife…
The one named “Please.”
Its blade cold, but not colder than your silence.
Place it slowly into my heart,
Like you once placed your trust in my hands.

Wrap your arms around my neck—
The same arms that wore the ring I gave.
But don’t worry,
I’ll make sure they stay clean.
Not a drop of blood will stain them—
Only rain.

I’ll laugh as you do it,
Because it’s all I have left.

This is my last wish.
Let it rain—
So the world won’t see what really happened.
No one will see the knife.
No one will hear the goodbye.

Because my sunshine,
You're not killing a body—
You’re letting a soul go
That only ever wanted
To die in your arms
