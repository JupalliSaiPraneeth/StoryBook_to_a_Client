Who is God?
Not a figure in the sky,
Nor a name etched in stone.
To me—
God is the soft whisper within,
A flicker of light when all feels dim.
God is the pulse of hope,
A warmth that steadies the soul.
We gave it a name—"God"—
But it was always within us,
Quiet,
Patient,
Whole.
When we believe,
Not in statues or skies,
But in the strength to rise again,
That belief births peace.
And that peace—
That’s God, too.
But more than anything,
My God has a face.
And she answers to “Mom.”
She never asked for worship,
Only that I eat well,
Sleep enough,
And follow my heart.
She doesn’t speak in riddles,
But in stories and lullabies.
She doesn’t demand sacrifice,
She is the sacrifice.
She holds no scripture,
But her silence teaches more than verses ever could.
She accepts my storms without judgment,
She translates my chaos into calm.
If God is love,
Then my mother is the temple.
If God is grace,
Then her hands are the altar.
And if I ever knelt to pray,
It was at her tired feet—
Not because she asked,
But because I knew:
If God had walked this Earth,
It was through her.
So I care for her
Not out of duty,
But devotion—
For in her eyes,
I found the only heaven I ever needed.
