All my hands were blue.
All my face was blue.
All my legs were blue.
Even my thoughts—blue.
Nobody ever got me,
Because I was blue.
Even when I was with everybody,
I wasn’t with anybody.
The silence that I felt inside myself—
It was blue too.
I could speak.
My lips moved,
But I couldn’t say a word,
Because those blue thoughts
Were louder than anything else.
Some teased me for being blue.
Some loved me for it.
But no one ever touched me,
Not really.
And no one ever gave me a reason why I was blue.
Then one day,
A witch came into my life.
She wasn’t the kind you fear in bedtime stories.
She had eyes like mystery and a voice that made silence blink.
At first, I was scared.
I kept my distance.
But then—
She accepted me.
She friended me.
She saw me for who I was.
Or maybe who I am.
And she touched my soul.
Not with hands,
But with something softer—
Something real.
That touch?
It enlightened me.
Little by little,
All my blue thoughts,
All my blue skin—
They began to fade
As the days went by.
My skin tone shifted—
From heavy blue
To something lighter.
Something almost white.
And for the first time,
People started to talk to me.
Less teasing.
More interaction.
The silence?
Gone.
I thought to myself:
"I'm becoming human again."
And I looked at the witch,
Really looked.
She wasn’t a witch.
She was an angel.
I went to her,
Smiling the way people do when they’re finally seen,
And I said,
"Thank you.
Without you… this wouldn’t have happened."
She smiled back.
And the next day,
The angel left.
Just like that.
The boy who had depended on her for everything—
Was left alone.
With one blue tear rolling down his cheek.
After she left,
My skin wasn’t blue anymore.
But it wasn’t white either.
It was something in between.
Dull.
And then—
Another angel came into my life.
I hoped again.
I prayed for brightness.
This time,
I didn’t even check.
I trusted her.
A lot.
I depended on her completely.
But she never considered my feelings.
Still, I trusted her.
Because she reminded me of the one
Who had once brought me back to life.
Who made me normal.
But no—
This time the angel turned into a witch.
Not the one who saved me.
The one who broke me.
The feelings I had for her?
The trust I kept in her?
They never existed to her.
She left me with ash-colored skin.
My mouth—tied.
My voice—gone.
I wanted to speak.
I needed to scream.
But I couldn’t.
And my soul—
It started to die.
Then I heard something—
Not from her.
Not from the world.
From me.
I listened.
“To be happy with yourself,
You need to depend on yourself,
Not the other person.
Happiness always finds its way
From within you.”
