The rain fell in a quiet drizzle—gentle enough for people to walk without umbrellas, yet restless enough to make the air hum. Around the auditorium, chaos stirred. The stage was set outdoors, and the weather had arrived uninvited.  

I stepped into the dancers' chamber, a surprise box tucked under my arm, damp from the rain. My hair clung to my forehead—I'd sprinted all the way.  

Ducking into the makeup room, I toweled off hastily, my fingers trembling as I wiped the droplets from my glasses. The scent of jasmine and sandalwood seeped under the door her scent. I took a breath, steadied myself, and pushed inside.  

And there she was.  

A glimpse. That was all it took.  

She sat before the mirror, her reflection a still-life painting awaiting the spark of life. But it was her eyes that held the magic—lined with kohl and edged with kajal, they were alive with stories. Stories of rage, divinity, sorrow, and love too vast to contain. Her eyebrows, meticulously shaped, were ready to lift and fall with expressions yet to be born.  

Her hair, oiled and woven into a sleek braid, was coiled into a bun. Jasmine spilled over it like stars scattered across a moonless night. A papidi billa crowned her, catching the golden glint of the dressing room lights.  

On her forehead, the bottu glowed—crimson like fire—flanked by the Chandra and Surya, symbols of balance, the universe, rhythm. Her jhumkas danced with her slightest movement, silent chimes to the music she carried within.  

Around her neck, a long haaram of rubies and gold swayed with every breath. Her wrists sang with bangles, soft yet proud.  

Then—she noticed me in the mirror.  

Shyness flickered across her face.  

Then, with the scent of flowers trailing behind her, she rushed toward me. I nearly lost my balance. She laughed, stepped back, and with those eyes—eyes no sun could outshine—she asked:  

"Nen ela unna?"

My mind spun—gorgeous, majestic, divine—every adjective clamoring to reach my lips. But I smirked, replying with mock arrogance:  

"Average... baane unnav."

Her smile faded. Her cheeks dimmed just slightly, and she turned back to the mirror.  

Then I said:  

"Okati takkuva ayyindi."

She looked at me, puzzled.  

"Entidi?" 

I sat beside the table and opened the surprise box.  

Her eyes widened.  

Gajjalu.

Wordlessly, I took her foot in my hands, resting it on my thigh. Her skin was warm, calloused from years of dance, yet impossibly soft. She watched, silent, as I fastened the anklets, the red threads weaving around her ankle like fate itself.  

When I finished, I looked up.  

"Ippudu perfect ga na andala Buttabomma laaga unnav," I murmured.  

A blush crept up her neck, her lips parting in surprise. The bottu on her forehead burned like a sun piercing storm clouds, and her eyes—God, those eyes—held me captive, pulling me into depths I'd drown in willingly.  

"Thanks, Pandu,<3" she whispered, the sound curling around my name like a melody.  

I would never forget it.  

Outside, the first beat of the auditorium thundered, calling her to the stage. She rose, the gajjalu chiming softly—a cascade of bells carrying the weight of every sacrifice, every blistered step, every dream.  

As she dipped her fingers into paarani, staining them red, I saw the shift—the woman fading, the dancer emerging. The mirror no longer held a mortal, but a vessel of the divine.  

And then she danced.  

Every footwork movement, every flick of her wrist, every glance she threw my way—it was a language only we understood. The rain faded. The crowd blurred. There was only her, her eyes locked onto mine, speaking in a silence louder than any music.  

Something wet trailed down my cheek.  

"Why was I crying?"  

Because I wasn't there.  

The screen before me flickered—her live performance, streaming on my laptop. The gajjalu lay in my palm, cold and unused.  

And the rain outside my window was the only applause she'd never hear.
